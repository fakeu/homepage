                      than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross
                      Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci
                      store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and
                      haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know
                      it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                      fault.

                    2005<br />
                    Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan
                    Spitalny: no grades, certificates and other bureaucracy, but
                    program offered courses in real estate, asset management
                    entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98% students gave
                    positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                    ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University
                    after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                  <li>
                    2002<br />
                    Acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and
                    reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue. I sure do like my
                    surname!

                  <li>
                    1999<br />
                    Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18
                    of them now in USA and abroad! Also switched to the Reform
                    Party that year
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1997<br />
                    Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River,
                    which was named Trump Place. Me and the other investors sold
                    our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest
                    residential sale in the history of New York City
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1996<br />
                    Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a
                    vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street. After an
                    extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump
                    Building
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1994<br />
                    Refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus
                    Circle, turned it into a 44-story luxury property known as
                    Trump International Hotel and Tower
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1989 ― 1992<br />
                    Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste
                    of money, I had to sell it, now it is American Airlines
                    Shuttle, btw
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1989, 1990<br />
                    Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very own
                    Tour de Trump. Is America not great enough for that cycling
                    competition?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1988<br />
                    Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million,
                    invested $50 million to restore the building and boosted it
                    from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona
                    Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash in 1995)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1987<br />
                    Registered as a Republican
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1985<br />
                    I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it
                    into a private club.You can join if you pay $200K initiation
                    fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very
                    expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino
                    called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                    she is another Trump!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1983<br />
                    I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team.
                    I changed team's play schedule and filed an antitrust
                    lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are
                    not doing so good now, but back then they were great!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1980<br />
                    Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan,
                    I payed a crew of undocumented Polish workers to demolish
                    the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco
                    features. All this to make architectural critic Paul
                    Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most
                    pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York
                    in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job
                    on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work
                    in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less
                    than the initial budget!

                    1978<br />
                    Purchased a 50 percent stake in the derelict Commodore Hotel
                    and turned it into the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 2 years of
                    remodeling
